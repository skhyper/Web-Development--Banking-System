About :----

Computerizing the transactions and entries is the main 
objective of the project. The application using PHP and MySQL 
handles some of the basic operations like 'view all users', 
'Transfer of money between multiple users', 'Display all 
transactions'. The homepage consists of two buttons, Start 
Now, which allows the admin to get started with the application, 
allowing him to view all the registered users. Only admin 
can access the portal, and view all customers. Show transactions
button allows the admin to view the history of all the 
transactions which allows the admin to track any credit/debit
issue if any. In the view page, basic details like name, email
of the user and their account balance is displayed. Once the 
admin clicks the transact button, the page redirects to 
transaction page where the detail of the person from whose 
account the money needs to be transfered is displayed.
